B.Sc. in Computing - Year 3 – Semester 2 – 2023/2024
Software Project - Project Requirements
Requirements 
You are required to design, develop, and test a 3-tier web application using a technology of your choosing. Students 
will normally work in groups of three. 
Required Core Aspects 
1) An appropriate development process must be actively applied, and code repositories used. 
2) An appropriate project management process must be used throughout, with project plans, monitoring and 
control activities recorded in Scrumwise.
3) Appropriate CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) operations using your chosen programming language
and/or SQL are to be used. 
4) Data storage using a relational database with five or more related tables. Database tables must be properly 
normalised and have appropriate integrity constraints implemented. 
5) The system should strive to provide all the functionality expected of the best of its type. 
6) Administrator and ordinary user functionality should be provided. 
7) Appropriate testing processes (unit, integration, system testing etc) and methods should be employed. 
8) User Experience (UX) aspects to be addressed; User Interface design, usability, accessibility.
9) Appropriate validation of input (both client-side and server-side). 
10) Security of access, data storage and transmission is to be incorporated. 
11) Documentation of system – i.e. User stories, ER-Diagrams, Javadoc or equivalent.
12) Appropriate use (and recognition) of design-patterns 
Other Aspects 
You may include one or more of the aspects below, and/or any additional aspects that you think are particularly 
relevant to your project. You must decide and explain which ones will bring additional value to your system. 
• Database Procedures 
o Implement a range of stored procedures and triggers relevant to your application. 
o Implement several database transactions where appropriate.
• Server-side logging in your server code for debugging and maintenance purposes. (e.g. log4J2) 
• Use of AJAX
• Localisation (internationalisation) 
• Use of non-relational database (e.g. MongoDB) (this is in addition to a relational DB) 
• Connection Pooling 
• Mobile access to web site 
Grading 
You should consider your project as an opportunity to create a comprehensive piece of work that can be used as part 
of your ‘portfolio of work’. (It should be something that you can present and refer to in a job interview). Within the 
scope of the topics mentioned above, and the time available, you should strive to develop an application, that is as 
comprehensive and professional as possible, both in terms of usefulness to the user and maintainability for the 
developer. 
You will be required to demonstrate your progress on a weekly basis throughout the semester. These meetings will be 
graded (based on attendance, productivity for the week and contribution at the meeting itself) and are worth 10% of 
your overall grade. There will be THREE grading stages: Stage-1, Stage-2 and, Stage-3 (final). (Refer to the Project 
Schedule). At each grading stage, you will present your work to the assessment panel that will assess and grade your 
work and give you verbal and written feedback. Feedback from the first two stages will be an important guide for you 
to determine your plan of work for the final iteration. Presentations and demonstrations are mandatory, and no 
marks will be allocated in their absence. 
The degree of difficulty of each aspect of your implementation, its relevance and completeness of implementation, 
and your demonstrated depth of understanding of each of the topic areas (as judged by the panel) will have a 
significant impact on grades. 
Record of Activity 
Teams and individuals must maintain an on-going record of their work. Tasks (investigation and research, requirements 
analysis, design activity, gaining technical competence, implementation/coding, testing) must be identified as part of 
the planning process. Teams must use the task board in Scrumwise to record activity. 
Breadth of Knowledge 
Each group member must have a working knowledge of all aspects of the project. Although individual members will 
obviously complete - and become more familiar with - specific parts of the project, it is up to each member, and the 
group as a whole, to ensure that every member is familiar with the workings of all aspects of the project. During 
progress reports and interviews, each member is expected to be able to answer questions about all aspects of the 
project. 
‘Group’ of ONE 
In cases where a member fails to engage with their team, the lecturing team may assign a person to work individually 
(in a Group of One). However, the full onus of meeting all the project requirements will rest with the individual, and it 
will be difficult to satisfy all project requirements in these circumstances.
Deliverables 
Weekly Deliverables via Iteration Meetings (10%)
On a weekly basis each team must present the work that they have completed over the previous week to their lecturer 
panel. This presentation will be done in the form of a stand-up meeting. A team leader will run the stand-up, and the 
team will outline how they decided on tasks and roles and will explain progress made. The team leader role must rotate 
between members each week. 
Each team member will explain his/her contribution for the week. Evidence of work done must be entered in a 
recording system (Scrumwise), and be presented to the lecturer panel, and subsequently be available online. This will 
consist of code snippets, references to articles, sample programs, sample database scripts, diagrams, short text 
documents explaining what has been learned, records of meetings, plans and schedules. (I.e. evidence of work done). 
These meetings will be graded based on attendance, productivity for the week and contribution at the meeting itself 
and are worth 10% of your overall grade.

1. Individual Contributions
2. Team Performance – (Management and Organisation, Task Allocation & Planning) 
3. Product Development – (functionality, data management, user-interface, design/system architecture, 
security, validation, testing, extras)
Stage-3 Assessment (40%)
